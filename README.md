DOCTOR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION

<a name="br3"></a>
INTRODUCTION

Welcome to my project, a system designed to help doctors track their elderly patients and manage healthcare tasks and activities. The system consists of two separate applications: one for doctors and one for patients.

The doctor application allows doctors to:

    Create and manage daily tasks for their patients.
    Track patient progress in real-time and manage their information.

The patient application enables patients to:

    View their assigned tasks and mark them as complete.
    Choose an activity to apply to their tasks.

<a name="br4"></a>
Doctor Application:

The doctor application provides the following key features for healthcare management:

    Patients Management: Manage patient information and track their progress.
    Daily Tasks Management: Assign daily tasks to patients with specific time frames, and track completion.
    Activities Management: Allow patients to select an activity for the day, and track completion.
    Dashboard: Provide a real-time view of patients and their current status.
    Messaging and Alerting: real-time alerts to doctors when patients have completed tasks or when their progress is off track.

Patient Application:

The patient application offers the following features:

    Assigned Tasks :  Patients can view the tasks assigned to them by their doctor and mark them as completed when finished.
    Activities :  Patients can select activities from a list provided by their doctor and mark them as completed when finished.

Why Two Applications and Microservices Architecture (with ‘RabbitMQ’ Message Broker):

    Microservices architecture allows teams to deploy independent applications without affecting other services in the architecture.
    Fault Isolation: If one or more applications fail, the rest of the system remains unaffected.
    Scalability: The system can handle more requests simultaneously, resulting in faster access for users.

Message Broker:
.A message broker is software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information.
.Message broker can store messages even if the receiving system is not currently connected or available.

Technologies Used:

    Front-end: React
    Back-end: Node.js
    Database: MongoDB
    Microservices Architecture
    Message broker: RabbitMQ
    UI library: Prime React
    Version control: GitHub

 Learned from this Project


    Real-time communication: using a message broker and microservices architecture.
    Message broker: RabbitMQ as a message broker to enable communication between microservices.
    Microservices architecture: implement a microservices architecture to build scalable and maintainable applications.
    Prime React: I used the UI library Prime React to create a modern and responsive user interface for the application.

Future futures 


    Improved User Experience for Elderly Patients
    Family Member Application
    Activity Management:  videos, photos, and location data to patient activities
    statistics and analytics capabilities to provide more insights and improve decision-making processes.

    Overcoming Challenges

During the project, I faced and overcame the following challenges:

    Building the entire project within a demanding deadline of just two weeks.
    Acquiring knowledge and implementing new concepts such as message brokers and microservices architecture.
    Balancing time between learning and implementing new concepts effectively.
